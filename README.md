# This is how it works
 
 
* :star2: GET **/books** - get all books;
* :star2: POST **/books** - add new book (jason);
* :star2: GET **/books/{id}** - get one book by id;
* :star2: PUT **/books** - update one book by id;
* :star2: DELETE **/books/{id}** - delete one book by id;

 Very satisfying for me at the beginning of my Java learning :blush:
